# SISOtemplates
 Templates for the SISO auto-induction feature. Module has a WYSIWYG with very limited styling capabilities. Source view strips out <style> and <script> tags - limiting what we can do in terms of look & feel and responsivity. The system also add's <br> whenever there is whitespace in the markup, so all the comments which are designed to assist the technicians building or maintaining the markup is producing unneccesary spacing between the elements. Markup will need to be cut down on final draft.

- move comments to the <div> ID property
- break template 'sections' with an <hr> 
- modify padding to match EdTech template
